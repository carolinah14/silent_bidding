# Silent Auction (Python)

A Python console application that simulates a silent auction. Multiple users can place bids anonymously, and the program determines the highest bidder at the end. This project demonstrates core Python concepts such as functions, dictionaries, loops, conditional logic, and importing code across multiple files.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Make sure both files are in the same folder:

   silent_bidding.py

   art.py
   
4. Open a terminal (or your preferred Python IDE).
5. Navigate to the folder containing the files.
6. Run the script using:

   python silent_bidding.py

7. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter bids and determine the auction winner.


## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Writing and using functions ( parameters and arguments)
- Storing data in dictionaries
- Dictionary subscripting to access values using keys
- Finding the highest value in a dictionary
- Using loops to collect multiple user inputs
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Importing code from another file
- Console-based user interaction
- Using ASCII art
